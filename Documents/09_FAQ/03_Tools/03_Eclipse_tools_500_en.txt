**RTSystemEditor
**** Operational performance of RTSystemEditor become worse.
RTSystemEditor always collects system information to synchronize display.
This collection of system information sometimes extremely slow when it
access to a reference of unworking object.
If there is such an unworking object, remove it by "Delete from NameService"
on the name service view. Moreover remove objects which connect to the
unworking object on the name service  and the system editor, then the
operation will be faster.

****The error occurs in NameService View of RTSystemEditor on Fedora Core.
When java is installed by yum when OS is Fedora Core, GCJ(The GNU Compiler
for Java ) is installed. There is a thing that the error occurs in
NameService View of RTSystemEditor when the GCJ is used. 
First of all, please confirm whether the Java of Sun Microsystems is used
when the error occurs. 
Please copy the jre directory that can be done by executing it after
jdk-xxx-linux-i586.bin is downloaded to the Eclipse installation directory
and use it when you want to apply the Java of Sun only to Eclipse. 
 $ sh jdk-6u4-linux-i586.bin
 $ cp -r jdk1.6.0_04/jre eclipse/

****There are duplicate connections between two ports in RTSystemEditor.
How can I tell them apart?
It is not possible to tell many connections apart. Check using the project file.

**RTCBuilder
****When saving the contents of the RTC Profile Editor to an RTC Profile, an "Error writing file." error appears. 
This error is displayed when the destination to save to is incorrect. Select
a directory within the project.

****Options of Service Port 

If you use service provider port, specify like this:
"--service=PortName:ServiceName:Type"

If you use service consumer port, specify like this:
"--consumer=PortName:ServiceName:Type"

These options have the following limits:

- Component name given by "--module-name=" must differ from service
interface name.
- "Type" must be the same as service interface name.
- Pair of provider and consumer should have the same "ServiceName" and "Type".
(Any ServiceName must be the one in the component.)

**Eclipse
&aname(eclipse);
****Method of starting Eclipse
*****For Windows system
Please look for eclipse.exe from the installation folder of Eclipse, and
double-click the icon. 
*****For UNIX system
The following explanations are the methods for bash the login shell.
:When environment variable RTM_JAVA_ROOT is set to/etc/profile|Please double-click the icon of eclipse by a file browser.Moreover, it is possible to start from the command line.
:When environment variable RTM_JAVA_ROOT is set to .bashrc|Please do not start by double-clicking. Please start the terminal and start Eclipse from the command line.  For instance, Eclipse can be started by the following commands when assuming that Eclipse is developed with/usr/Eclipse.~
 $ /usr/Eclipse/eclipse

::Reason to avoid start by double-clicking|When the code of RTC that RTCBuilder generated is built with ant, environment variable RTM_JAVA_ROOT is used.When Eclipse is started by double-clicking, bashrc that is the configuration file is not read. Therefore, Ant might fail to build.

**** Method of simply applying Java(JRE) of Sun to Eclipse on UNIX system environment
When java is installed in the environment of UNIX system, GCJ(The GNU
Compiler for Java ) is often installed. (A lot of Linux distributions are
pertinent. )｡If Eclipse tools are operated by versions other than since Sun
JRE 1.6, the problems are caused.If possible, it is ideal to install [[JDK6
of Sun.>/en/node/664#instjavaunixjdk]] 
However, for the time being
Please do the following in case of "I want to make the use of the Java of
Sun only Eclipse". 
Please obtain jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin
[[here.:https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jdk-6u21-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer]]
Please copy the jre directory that can be done by executing it to the
Eclipse installation directory. 
:: Example of method of applying use of JRE of Sun only to Eclipse
（jdk-6u4-linux-i586.bin）
 $ sh jdk-6u4-linux-i586.bin
 $ cp -r jdk1.6.0_04/jre eclipse/
