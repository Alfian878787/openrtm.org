For uses who require more flexibility, or wish to alter and use the source, OpenRTM-aist-Java can be installed from source.

** Building a source distribution

OpenRTM-aist-Java provides a build environment for Eclipse.

***Dependencies

Building OpenRTM-aist-Java requires the following libraries.

-Eclipse SDK 3.3.x or greater.
-jdk1.5.0_xx or greater.

Install these dependencies according to their individual documentations. Installing them into standard locations such as /usr and /usr/local will make compiling OpenRTM-aist-Python easier.

***Download the source

Download the OpenRTM-aist-Java source from [[here>http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/java/]].

***Extract the source code

Extract the OpenRTM-aist-Java.X.X.X.tar.gz file into a suitable location.

- For Linux:
 $ tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-Java-X.X.X.tar.gz
- For Windows, use a suitable tool to extract the file, such as 7Zip.

*** Build

The diagrams in this section show Windows and Eclipse 3.4.2.

Start Eclipse and import the project into the workspace by selecting "Import" from the File menu.


#ref(eclipse_open_import_en.png,40%,center)
CENTER: ''Importing the project''

Select "Import an existing project" and click "Next."


#ref(eclipse_select_import_en.png,60%,center)
CENTER: ''Import selection window''

Select the folder with the extract files and click "Finish."


#ref(eclipse_select_project_en.png,60%,center)
CENTER: ''Project import window''

This will import the project into the current workspace.


#ref(eclipse_open_project_en.png,60%,center)
CENTER: ''Importing a project''

Right click the build.xml file in the package explorer and select "Ant build" from the "Debug" menu.


#ref(eclipse_select_ant_built_en.png,40%,center)
CENTER: ''"Ant build"''

From the displayed window, select "buildAllLinux" and click the "Debug" button.


#ref(eclipse_execute_ant_en.png,60%,center)
CENTER: ''Edit configuration window''

The build will begin.


#ref(eclipse_execution_result_en.png,80%,center)
CENTER: ''Build result''

If the console window displays the above result, the build has completed.

**Buidling from the repository

The OpenRTM-aist-Python source code is stored in a publicly-available Subversion repository. This source code can be checked out and built.


***Necessary tools

[[Subversion and its Eclipse plugin>http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.0.x]] are necessary to access the repository from Eclipse.

***Check out the source

The diagrams in this section show Windows and Eclipse 3.4.2.

Check out the source code in Eclipse and import it into the workspace. From the File menu select "Import". In the dialog, select "Check out project from SVN" in the "Other" category and click "Next." In the next dialog, select "Repository location" and click "Next." Set the URL of the repository to ''http://www.openrtp.jp/openrtm/svn/OpenRTM-aist-Java/trunk/'' and click "Next." In the folder selection window, select "jp.go.aist.rtm.RTC."
