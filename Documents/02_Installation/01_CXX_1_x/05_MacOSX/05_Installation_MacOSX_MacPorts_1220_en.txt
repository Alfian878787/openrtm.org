**MacPorts

MacPorts is a system to allow the installation and management of open-source software packages in Mac OS X. It is based on the ports system of FreeBSD. A recipe known as a "portfile" describes how to automatically compile and install a package, including downloading source and applying patches. There is also another system for Mac OS X, known as Fink.

***Installing with MacPorts

To use MacPorts, Apple's Xcode and an X11 environment must be installed. These can be installed from the Mac OS X install CD. See the MacPorts webpage for details.

MacPorts uses dmg package files. You must select the dmg file that matches your operating system version. The dmg files can be downloaded from the MacPorts website:

-[[for Snow Leopard:http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.1-10.6-SnowLeopard.dmg]]
-[[for Leoperd:http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.1-10.5-Leopard.dmg]]
-[[for Tiger:http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.9.1-10.4-Tiger.dmg]]

**Install OpenRTM-aist by the ports

A script to download the portfile and automatically build and install it is available:

-[[Portfile:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/MacOSX/macports/ports.tgz]]
-[[Install script:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/MacOSX/macports/port_install.sh]]: Automatically downloads ports.tgz and installs it.

In an appropriate directory, execute the script as below. You will be asked for a superuser password during the install.

 $ sh port_install100_mac.sh
 sh port_install.sh
 file:///Users/n-ando/ports/
