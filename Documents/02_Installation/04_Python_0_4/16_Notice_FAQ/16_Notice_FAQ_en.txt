**Notice: Environment variables 
***Environment Variable PYTHONPATH 
Please make sure the environment variable PYTHONPATH is properly specified when using OpenRTM for Python. When it is not properly specified, you might not be able to run the component.

Note: In rtc-template, as the first element of PYTHONPATH is referred, set the path for the site-packages (/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages) on the top of PYTHONPATH.

***Environment Variable Path 
Add the path of the Python installed folder to the environment variable PATH, so you do not have to set the full path of python.exe. Especially since there are possibility of multiple python.exe in the environment that Cygwin etc is installed, please set the environment variable PATH to the search path of target phthon.exe first priority

**Notice: rtc-template 

***When using std::vector with "--config" option, please specify the option as follows. 

 [C++]
 --config="vector_param0:std::vector<double>:0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0"

Pease modify std::vector<double> to double like this:

 [Python]
 --config="vector_param0:double:0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0"

**Notice: Implementing the Components that have Service Provider Port 

If you specify an IDL file named MyService.idl with --service-idl option, a file named MyService_idl_example.py will be generated after running rtc-template.

This file is the file to implement operarion defined in IDL, so please write the implementation code for the operation in this.
