**Execution of RT-Component
USBCamera is a sample that acquires the image data of the USB camera by
USBCameraAqcuireComp Component, and displays it by USBCameraMonitorComp
Component in the monitor. You can put the effect on the image data by
connecting the RT sample component of OpenCV. 

- Please install the driver of the USB camera used. 
- Please install OpenCV when you use the USB camera. 
- Please install it from an installer (for VC2008)
[[here>http://downloads.sourceforge.net/opencvlibrary/OpenCV_1.0.exe?modtime=1161287502&big_mirror=1]]
when you use OpenCV sample RT component.
