**Introduction
This sample shows how to use configuration set for RT-Components. Once you
launch ConfigSample component, its sample component starts up. Once the
component launches successfully, its configuration set has been set up on
ahead. You may confirm the configuration by RTSystemEditor.

Note: If an error "Specified path cannot be found." occurs, modify the value
of "example.ConfigSample.config_file" in rtc.conf file under
RTMExamples/ConfigSample directory.

-Rewrite the path to:
 .\\RTMExamples\\ConfigSample\\configsample.conf
 
 (Any characters between folder names are represented by '\' and not '\\'.)

-Or rewrite it to the full path of "configsample.conf". In this case, you
need to specify '\\' as a folder separator, as well.
