This sample is bundled to the C++ edition, the Python edition, and the Java
edition of OpenRTM-aist.

**Introduction

The sample shows how to use InPort and OutPort. Execute SeqIn component and
SeqOut component, then each sample component starts and a GUI screen is
displayed. Both SeqIn and SeqOut have the following type of DataPort:
TimedShort, TimedLong, TimedFloat, TimedDouble TimedShortSeq, TimedLongSeq,
TimedFloatSeq and TimedDoubleSeq. Outputs of each port are determined by a
random number, and once you connect ports, output values of SeqOut and input
values of SeqIn are displayed in the GUI screen, respectively. (You may use
RTSystemEditor to connect between Ports.)

**Execution of RT-Component
This is a sample of the data port of the sequence type. 
SeqOut outputs the consecutive numerical data. SeqIn inputs the continuous
data. And, it is displayed on GUI. Please connect the port of corresponding
SeqOut and SeqIn by RTSystemEditor.
When both components are activated,
Not only the numerical value on GUI of SeqOut but also the numerical value
on GUI of SeqIn changes continuously. The I/O of the data port can be
observed.

You can execute this sample with the following procedures. 
-- Start RTSystemEditor.
-- Run SeqIn and SeqOut, then each sample component starts. The start of the
component is different according to OS and the edition of OpenRTM-aist.
Please refer to the following tables.

-- Both components are displayed on NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor. To
add a RTcomponent to the System Editor from the Name Service View into the
System Editor.
-- Drag and drop between two ports to connect them.
-- RTcomponents Activate.
