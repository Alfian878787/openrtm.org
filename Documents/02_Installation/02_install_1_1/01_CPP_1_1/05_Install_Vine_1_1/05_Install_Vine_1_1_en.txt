RPM packages are provided for installing the C++ edition of OpenRTM-aist in Vine Linux. The supported distribution versions are listed on the download page. The corresponding versions may change or be discontinued without notice.

There are two methods of installation available:

-Use the provided install script.
-Install via the apt-get package manager.

** Vine Linux batch installation script
//**Install script

Download the installation script '' pkg_install [version number] _vine.sh '' provided by openrtm.org from the download page and execute it with root privilege.
This script installs required packages sequentially with apt-get.

- [[Package installation script:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/cxx/install_scripts/]]

It is very convenient because it installs all necessary packages for developing and executing OpenRTM-aist. It is recommended for those who try installing OpenRTM-aist for the first time.
However, since all the packages related to OpenRTM - aist are installed, there is a possibility that even unnecessary ones are installed. If you know more, you should install it manually.
Below is the installation procedure using the batch installation script.

//Download the appropriate build script for your distribution ("pkg_install[version]_vine.sh") from the download page and execute it with root permissions. This script will automatically install the necessary dependencies using apt-get.

//This script is convenient for installing the many packages necessary for developing and executing OpenRTM-aist-based systems. It is recommended that first-time users of OpenRTM-aist use it. However, it installs all packages that may be needed for working with OpenRTM-aist, which may include packages that you do not specifically need. Experienced users of OpenRTM-aist should use another installation method.

//The procedure for using the script is described below.

 > wget [pkg_installXXX.sh download URL]
 > su
 # sh pkg_install1XX_vine.sh
 // Questions will be asked during the procedure. Answer "y" or "Y" when appropriate.

**Using rpm

***Editing sources.list

A package repository that can be used from apt-get is provided by openrtm.org. This is not included in the default package repositories, so it must be entered into the apt-get settings manually. Append one of the following lines to the file /etc/apt/sources.list:

 rpm http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Linux/Vine/apt x.x/$(ARCH) main

where "x.x" is the Vine version number, e.g. 5.0 for Vine 5.0.

 rpm http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Linux/Vine/apt 5.0/$(ARCH) main

After editing sources.list, follow the procedure given below to install.

 > su
 # apt-get update
 # apt-get install gcc-c++ python
 # apt-get install omniORB omniORB-devel omniORB-servers omniORB-doc
 # apt-get install e2fsprogs e2fsprogs-devel
 # apt-get install OpenRTM-aist OpenRTM-aist-devel OpenRTM-aist-doc OpenRTM-aist-example

Answer "y" or "Y" to questions as appopriate.

***Checking the install

To confirm the installation succeeded, use the following command.

 # rpm -q OpenRTM-aist
 OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0-0.vl50
