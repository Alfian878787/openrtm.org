[[Eclipse>http://www.eclipse.org/]] is an open-source Integrated Development Environment framework developed by the Eclipse Foundation for developing in Java and other languages. Eclipse is, at its core, a platform for plugins to execute in, combining a wide variety of plugins to create various development environments. Even the default Java development environment is implemented as a plugin, and development environments for other languages can be created and expanded using other plugins.

The characteristics of Eclipse include:
&br;

-Easily extensible using plugins. Plugins can also cooperate.
-Using the Rich Client Platform (RCP) structure, plugins can function in a standalone mode.
-Because it is written in Java, it functions on many platforms.
These characteristics are very useful for constructing a robot-oriented development environment. For this reason, it was selected as the platform for the RT Middleware tools.

And so on.
Judging that these Eclipse features are useful for constructing an integrated development environment for robot, we chose Eclipse as a platform for tools of RT middleware.

To use RTCBuilder and RTSystemEditor you need to install Eclipse.

*** Installing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
Since Eclipse is a Java application, you need to install Oracle's Java execution environment [[((JRE: Java Runtime Environment):https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]].
Installing JRE is not necessary in an environment where JDK (Java development environment, however, ''1.6 or higher'') is already installed. (RTCBuilder requires JDK instead of JRE to generate Java code.)
- [[JRE download:https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]]

After downloading please install according to the instructions of the installer.

//Before installing Eclipse, install a suitable Java, such as Sun's [[Java Runtime Environment (JRE)>http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]]. If you already have a Java Development Environment (JDK) version 1.6 or above installed, there is no need to install a separate JRE. (If you will be generating Java code using RTC Builder, you will need to have a JDK installed; the JRE will not be sufficient.)
