// Title: SimpleIO
#contents

This sample is included with the C++, Python and the Java editions of OpenRTM-aist.
&br;

**Introduction

This is a sample showing how to use InPort and OutPort. Launch the ConsoleIn component and the ConsoleOut component.
When connecting between ports, the number entered on the ConsoleIn side is displayed on the ConsoleOut side. In addition to using RTSystemEditor between Port, you can connect by running Connector.

This sample transmits data using data ports.  ConsoleIn sends ConsoleOut the input numerical value via data port.  ConsoleOut displays the numerical value.
Input the numerical value in ConsoleIn's window.  ConsoleOut will display the numerical value that you entered.

-- Launch Eclipse and prepare the RTSystemEditor. → For details on how to use RTSystemEditor, see [[RTSystemEditor >/node/1175]]
-- Start both ConsoleIn and ConsoleOut components.
Since the startup of the component depends on the OS and the language of OpenRTM-aist, start it with reference to the following table.
|LEFT:110|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|c
||>|CENTER:Windows|>|CENTER:Linux|
||ConsoleIn component|ConsoleOut component|ConsoleIn component|ConsoleOut component|
|C++|ConsoleInComp.exe|ConsoleOutComp.exe|ConsoleInComp|ConsoleOutComp|
|Python|ConsoleIn.py|ConsoleOut.py|ConsoleIn.py|ConsoleOut.py|
|Java|ConsoleIn.bat|ConsoleOut.bat|ConsoleIn.sh|ConsoleOut.sh|

-- Both components will appear in NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor, so drag them onto SystemEditor.
-- Connect the ports of both components. (See SimpleIO execution example above)
-- Right-click on either component and select "All Activate".
-- ConsoleIn prompts you to "Please input number:", so enter the number.
-- The number is displayed on the ConsoleOut screen.
