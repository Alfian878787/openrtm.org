This sample is included with the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist. It is not included in the C++ or Java editions.

***Introduction

TkJoyStickComp is a graphical virtual joystick component (see image, below).
The centre circle can be dragged like a joystick to send X/Y values out its
upper OutPort. The lower OutPort outputs values suitable for controlling a
differential drive robot, such as the Tribot.

***Running the sample
Connect with TkJoystickComp.py (input device) · TkMotorComp.py (output device) etc and simulate a robot which moves with a motor with a GUI.
//TkJoystickComp.py (input device) and TkMotorComp.py (output device) can
//optionally be used with the simulator for input and output. Please refer to
//[[Development of RT-Components for LEGO Mindstorms:/node/762]] for details.

Use the following procedure to execute the sample.
- Procedure
- Start RTSystemEditor and prepare SystemEditor. → For details on how to use RTSystemEditor, see [[RTSystemEditor >/node/1175]]
- Start TkJoyStickComp.py, TkMobileRobotSimulator.py, both components.
- Click the [Create] button of the GUI of TkMobileRobotSimulator.py once.
- Since both components are displayed in NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor, drag them onto SystemEditor.
- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (See SystemEditor execution example above)
- Right-click on either component and select "All Activate".
//-Start RTSystemEditor.
//-Run TkJoyStickComp.py and TkMobileRobotSimulator.py.
//-Click the Create button in TkMobileRobotSimulator.
//-Both components are displayed in the name service view of RTSystemEditor. Add
//the components to the System Editor.
//-Drag and drop between two ports to connect them.
//-Activate the components.
