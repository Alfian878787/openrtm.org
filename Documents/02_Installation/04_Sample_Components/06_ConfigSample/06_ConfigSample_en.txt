This sample is included with the C++, Python and the Java editions of
OpenRTM-aist.

**Introduction

This sample shows how to use configuration sets for RT-Components. When you
launch the ConfigSample component, its configuration set is set up
automatically. You can check and alter the configuration using RTSystemEditor.

Note: If an error "Specified path cannot be found" occurs, modify the value of
"example.ConfigSample.config_file" in rtc.conf file under the
RTMExamples/ConfigSample directory. Change it to:

 .\\RTMExamples\\ConfigSample\\configsample.conf

(Any characters between folder names are represented by '\' and not '\\'.)

or rewrite it to the full path of "configsample.conf". In this case, you
need to specify '\\' as a folder separator, as well.

**Running the sample

This sample keeps displaying the configuration set data of the component in the
shell. It updates the display when the configuration data is changed in
RTSystemEditor.

- Start RTSystemEditor.
- Run ConfigSample. Starting the components varies by operating system and
  OpenRTM-aist version. Please refer to the following table.
|LEFT:110|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|c
||CENTER:Windows|CENTER:Linux|
|C++|ConfigSampleComp.exe|ConfigSampleComp|
|Python|ConfigSample.py|ConfigSample.py|
|Java|ConfigSample.bat|ConfigSample.sh|
- Activate the component in RTSystemEditor.
- In the "Configuration" view of RTSystemEditor, choose a set to activate and
  edit configuration parameters, clicking Apply to make the changes take
  effect. View the changes in the shell.
