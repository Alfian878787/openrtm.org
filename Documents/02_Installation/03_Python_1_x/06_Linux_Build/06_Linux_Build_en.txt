For distributions that do not yet have a pre-built package available, or for users who wish to alter the OpenRTM-aist source themselves, it is possible to build OpenRTM-aist from source.

**Building the source

The Python edition of OpenRTM-aist uses the distutils module to build, allowing it to be built in a variety of environments.

***Supported operating systems and distributions

OpenRTM-aist-Python has been tested and confirmed to work on the following distributions.

- FreeBSD
- Vine Linux
- Fedora
- Debian
- Ubuntu

It should be possible to build and use OpenRTM-aist-Python on other versions of Linux/UNIX.

***Dependencies

OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.0.0 depends on the folloowing environmental tools and libraries.

-Python
-omniORBpy: Needed to compile the IDL files.

Install these dependencies according to their individual documentations. Installing them into standard locations such as /usr and /usr/local will make compiling OpenRTM-aist-Python easier.

***Download the source

Download the OpenRTM-aist-Python source code from the download page.

-http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/python/

***Extract the source

Extract the source code from the OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.tar.gz file into a suitable location.

 $ tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.tar.gz
 $ cd OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X

*** Build 

OpenRTM-aist uses autotools for building. It can be built in the same way as any other distutils-based package.

 $ python setup.py build [options]

The usable options are listed in the help:

 $ python setup.py --help

*** Install

When the build completes successfully, use this command to install:

 $  su
 # python setup.py install

This completes the installation.

**Building from the repository

The OpenRTM-aist-Python source code is stored in a publicly-available Subversion repository. This source code can be checked out and built.

***Checkout the source

Checkout the source from the repository as below.

 Checked out revision 349.

*** Build

After checking out, a directory called OpenRTM-aist-Python will have been created. Change to this directory.

 $ ls 
 OpenRTM-aist-Python
 $ cd OpenRTM-aist-Python
 $ ls
 MANIFEST.in           OpenRTM-aist.pth  README      setup.py
 MANIFEST_examples.in  OpenRTM_aist/     installer/

Use setup.py to build and install.

 $ python setup.py build

***Making a distributable source package

By executing the command shown below, a source package such as those available at openrtm.org can be created. In order to make a distribution package, some additional tools are necessary, such as doxygen, latex, and qkc.

 $ python setup.py sdist

 $ ls -l dist/OpenRTM-aist-Python-*
 -rw-r--r-- 1 kurihara kurihara 425300 2010-07-29 22:06 dist/OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.0.0.tar.gz
 -rw-r--r-- 1 kurihara kurihara 597929 2010-07-29 22:06 dist/OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.0.0.zip
 -rw-r--r-- 1 kurihara kurihara  58071 2010-07-29 22:07 dist/OpenRTM-aist-Python-example-1.0.0.tar.gz

The following packages are created:

-OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.0.0.zip: Windows source
-OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.0.0.tar.gz: Generic source (gzipped)
-OpenRTM-aist-Python-example-1.0.0.tar.gz: Samples source (gzipped)
