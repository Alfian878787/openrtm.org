**RTC Builder 
RTC Builder is a template generator tool for RT Components. It generates custom templates based on user-configured parameters. RTC Builder operates on top of Eclipse and interacts seamlessly and intuitively with other Eclipse plugins.
Although RTC Builder can be used even if RT System Editor is not installed, if it is, RTC Builder's menus will be integrated with those of RT System Editor. This document is written assuming RT System Editor is installed.


***Functional Overview

|Function|Overview|
|RTC Profile Editor|Edit the RTC specification based profile, data port definitions, service port definitions, configuration parameter definitions, and other profile extensions.|
|Build view|Graphically display the RT Component being edited, including its data ports, service ports, service interfaces.|
|Repository view|Display information on a selected RT Repository.|

***Operating Environment
The following must be installed for RTC Builder to function.
|Software|Remarks|
|[[Java Development Kit 6:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]]|&color(red){Note: Java1.5 (5.0) is not suitable.};|
|Eclipse version 3.4.2 or above &br; http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php &br; http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.php|Eclipse itself|
|[[Eclipse EMF version 2.2 or above (SDO, XSD included):http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/downloads/]]|Eclipse plugin required by RTC Builder &br; Note: be sure to use versions that match your Eclipse version.|
|[[Eclipse GEF version 3.2 or above (Draw2D included):http://www.eclipse.org/gef/downloads/]]|Eclipse plugin required by RTC Builder &br; Note: be sure to use versions that match your Eclipse version.|

If you will be generating components for C++ or Python, you will need the following as well:

**Install RTC Builder 
Because RTC Builder is an Eclipse plugin, it requires Eclipse to be installed. Eclipse is written in Java, so it in turn requires a Java environment to be set up before it can be installed (such as the JDK).
- Please refer to [["Installation of Java execution environment (JRE) of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#jre_install]] for the installation of the Java execution environment. 
-Please refer to [["Installation of Eclipse of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#eclipse_install]] for the installation of Eclipse.  

// *** Installing the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
// Before installing Eclipse, install a suitable Java, such as Sun's [[Java
// Runtime Environment (JRE)>http://www.java.com/ja/download/manual.jsp]]. If
// you already have a Java Development Environment (JDK) version 1.6 or above
// installed, there is no need to install a separate JRE. (If you will be
// generating Java code using RTC Builder, you will need to have a JDK
// installed; the JRE will not be sufficient.)
// -[[JRE download>http://www.java.com/ja/download/manual.jsp]]
// -[[JRE (Windows) online installer>http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=11145]]
// -[[JRE (Windows) online installer>http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=11193]]
// -[[Java Development Kit 6:http://java.sun.com/javase/ja/6/download.html]]

// Follow the displayed instructions to install after downloading.

*** Installing and Starting RTC Builder 
Download the [[RTC Builder plugin:/en/node/529]] and copy the jar files into the Eclipse plugin directory. This is a directory called ''plugin'' below the ''eclipse'' directory in the location you extracted the Eclipse archive to.  Download the Start Eclipse and select ''Open Perspective''->''Other'' from the ''Window'' menu. The perspective selection dialog will be displayed.
