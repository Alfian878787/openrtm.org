**Procedures of Installation 
There are some examples of how to replace with Debian, you seem to be able to replace with Debian the easiest according to the procedure of sushi-k-nisshi2-san.
-Replace with Debian according to the procedure in [[sushi-k-nisshi2-san:http://w3.quake3.jp/sushi-k/wp/?p=93]] site.
-Install the required package with apt-get.(or the installation script is used)
-Build of OpenRTM-aist
-Installation


*Switch of OS 
Please follow the procedure in sushi-k-san. A hard disk that you use should be unformatted.

**Switch of tar 
You switch tar  because it seems not to be able to use "tar" of BusyBox.
 # wget http://w3.quake3.jp/sushi-k/pool/kuropro/debian/gnutar_kuropro.gz
 You can transfer this from Windows to a Kurobox via samba.
 # gzip -dc gnutar_kuropro.gz >/bin/tar
 # chmod a+x /bin/tar [Enter]


**Installing Debian kit 
You download the Debian kit and extract it in the root.
 # wget http://w3.quake3.jp/sushi-k/pool/kuropro/debian/debian_kit.tar.gz [Enter]
 # tar xvzpf debian_kit.tar.gz -C / [Enter]

**Transfer of Debian image 
In KuroBox PRO, you put the following file in the shared directory "mtd device(/mnt/mtd)".
-uImage.buffalo
-hddrootfs.tar.gz
-ChangeMeDevHDD
-ChangeMyUbootEnv~

Hold down the reset switch in the back, then system construction for HDD boot starts automatically. (this is written in Manual).


Download the disc image of Debian from [[here:http://w3.quake3.jp/sushi-k/pool/kuropro/debian/]], and put these file on mtd device.
You can do this from Windows via samba or get it with wget.


**HDD boot Environment Construction 
Hold down the reset switch for 5 seconds in the back. Orange info lamp blinks in front, and partitioning of HDD, extracting the format and the image etc are done. You don't have to dare to log out because you can see an inside condition while you log in. When the info lamp turns off, the proceeding is sure to have finished. KuroBox that is replaced with Debian is sure to start.

**Configuration 
This system is the following settings immediately after restart. 

|IP address | 192.168.1.81 |
|root password | kuroadmin |
You can login only by ssh, so you login from an appropriate ssh client to set it. 

*Build of OpenRTM-aist 
**Installation of package 
To install the package, you can use the package installer for Debian(pkg_install_debianSarge.sh) without modification, which is included in OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0.
Once you extracted the source of OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0, switch to root and just run pkg_install_debianSarge.sh under the build directory.

 > tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0.tar.gz
 > cd OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0
 > cd build
 > ls
 (snip)
 README.Debian  makewrapper.py             pkg_install_vl32.sh
 autogen        pkg_install_debianSarge.sh  pkg_install_vl4.sh
 (snip)
 > su
 # ./pkg_install_debianSarge.sh

That's all for installation of the package.

**Build of OpenRTM-aist 
The following procedure is as same as for a normal PC.

 > cd OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0
 > ./configure
 > make
 > su
 # make install

However, it takes quite a long time(about 1 hour and 45 minutes) to build.

 > time make
 5898.850u 251.470s 1:43:47.10 98.7%     0+0k 0+0io 278pf+0w

It is not so different from KuroBox HG.
