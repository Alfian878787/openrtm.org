There are two methods available for installing:

-Use the apt-get or synaptic package manager.

**Vine Linux installer script

Download the "pkg_install_python_vine.sh" install script provided on the download page of openrtm.org and execute it with root permissions. This script will install the necessary dependencies using apt-get.

-[[Install script:http://www.openrtm.org/OpenRTM-aist/download/install_scripts/]]

Installing all the packages needed for development with OpenRTM-aist takes some work. For new users, using the install script is recommended. However, this will install all packages used by OpenRTM-aist, even though you may not need them. Expert users should consider installing manually using apt-get or synaptic.

Follow these steps to use the install script.

 > wget [pkg_install_python_vine.sh download URL]
 > su
 # sh pkg_install1_python_vine.sh
 // Answer "y" or "Y" to the questions to proceed.

**Using apt-get

***Edit sources.list

Openrtm.org provides a package repository for use with apt-get. This is not included in the default package repository, so it must be added to the apt-get settings by hand. Add the following line to the file "/etc/apt/sources.list" (root permissions will be required):

 rpm http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Linux/Vine/apt x.x/$(ARCH) main

Replace "x.x" with your Vine Linux version. For example, use "5.0" for Vine 5.0:

 rpm http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Linux/Vine/apt 5.0/$(ARCH) main

Next, run these commands to install OpenRTM-aist.

 > su
 # apt-get update
 # apt-get install python
 # apt-get install omniORB-servers omniORBpy omniORBpy-devel omniORBpy-standarda
 # apt-get install OpenRTM-aist-Python OpenRTM-aist-Python-example

Answer "y" or "Y" to the questions to proceed. You can replace the apt-get command with the synaptic command.

***Confirm installation

Check the install was successful using the following command.

 # rpm -qa | grep OpenRTM-aist-Python
 OpenRTM-aist-Python-example-1.0.0-RELEASE.vlXX
