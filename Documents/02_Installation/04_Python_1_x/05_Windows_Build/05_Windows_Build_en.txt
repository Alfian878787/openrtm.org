For those who wish to install from a source package, it is possible to build OpenRTM-aist-python manually.

**Source code for Windows

The Windows source code for the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist is distributed separately from the source code for Linux. The source is entirely the same, but the character sets are different. The Windows source uses Shift-JIS while the Linux source uses EUC.

***Source code organisation

The original code is stored in a Subversion repository. The Windows and Linux source packages are built from this in Linux. The Windows source package is also built on Windows.

**Build environment

The necessary tools and libraries for building are:

-Python
-omniORBpy

*** Python
Download the latest 2.x Python from this site and install it.

-[[Python Official Website:http://www.python.org/]]

The installation package presents several options. The defaults are suitable.

*** omniORBpy

The omniORBpy library is necessary to build the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist. omniORBpy can be obtained from the link below. Source packages and binaries are available. However, openrtm.org provides a pre-built binary installer that may be more convenient.

-[[omniORB official:http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/]]
--[[sourceforge download page:http://sourceforge.net/projects/omniorb/files/omniORBpy/]]
-[[MSI package provided by openrtm.org:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Windows/omniORB/]]
--The omniORBpy installers are separated by Python version. Be sure to use an installer matching your Python version.

** Obtaining a source package.

Download a source package, named OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.zip, and extract it in a suitable directory.

-[[OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.zip:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/python/1.0.0/]]

** Build

Start a command prompt and change to the directory where you extracted the source code. Execute the following commands.

 > OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X
 > python setup.py build

** Install

Once everything has built successfully, execute the following command to install it.

 > python setup.py install
