An RPM package for installing the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist on Fedora Linux is available. The supported Fedora Linux versions are listed on the download page. The Fedora Linux versions may change without notice.

There are two methods available for installing:

-Use the installer script provided by openrtm.org.
-Use the yum package manager.

**Fedora installer script

Download the "pkg_install_python_fedora.sh" install script provided on the download page of openrtm.org and execute it with root permissions. This script will install the necessary dependencies using apt-get.

-[[Install script:http://www.openrtm.org/OpenRTM-aist/download/install_scripts/]]

Installing all the packages needed for development with OpenRTM-aist takes some work. For new users, using the install script is recommended. However, this will install all packages used by OpenRTM-aist, even though you may not need them. Expert users should consider installing manually using yum.

Follow these steps to use the install script.

 > wget [pkg_install_python_fedora.sh download URL]
 > su
 # sh pkg_install1_python_fedora.sh
 // Answer "y" or "Y" to the questions to proceed.

**Using yum

***Create /etc/yum.repos.d/openrtm.repo

Openrtm.org provides a package repository for use with apt-get. This is not included in the default package repository, so it must be added to the apt-get settings by hand. Create a file called "/etc/yum.repos.d/openrtm.repo" (root permissions will be required), and add the following lines to it.

 [openrtm]
 name=Fedora $releasever - $basearch
 failovermethod=priority
 baseurl=http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Linux/Fedora/releases/$releasever/Fedora/$basearch/os/Packages
 enabled=1
 gpgcheck=0
 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY
CENTER:''/etc/yum.repos.d/openrtm.repo''

***Install

After making the file above, execute these commands to install with yum. Answer "y" to the questions to proceed.

 > su
 # yum install python
 # yum install omniORB-servers omniORBpy omniORBpy-devel omniORBpy-standard
 # yum install OpenRTM-aist-Python OpenRTM-aist-Python-example

***Confirm installation

Check the install was successful using the following command.

 # rpm -qa | grep  OpenRTM-aist-Python
 OpenRTM-aist-Python-example-1.0.0-RELEASE.fcx.i386
