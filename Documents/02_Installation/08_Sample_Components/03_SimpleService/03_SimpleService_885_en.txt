This sample is bundled to the C++ edition, the Python edition, and the Java
edition of OpenRTM-aist.

**Introduction
This sample shows how to use ServicePort. The service is defined using the
following IDL.

 typedef sequence<string> EchoList;
 typedef sequence<float> ValueList;
 
 interface MyService
 {
   string echo(in string msg);
   EchoList get_echo_history();
   void set_value(in float value);
   float get_value();
   ValueList get_value_history();
 };

Startup MyServiceConsumer.bat and MyServiceProvider.bat, then each sample
component starts. Activate the component of Consumer, then command list is
displayed so please try each command. (Please use RTSystemEditor to connect
between Ports.)

**Execution of RT-Component
SimpleService is a sample to send the command from MyServiceConsumer, and to
process it by MyServiceProvider. (The Consumer side parses the command and
calls the function of the Provider side. )
Please connect the port of MyServiceConsumer and the port of
MyServiceProvider by RTSystemEditor.When both components are activated, the
command list is displayed in the prompt on the Consumer side.Please input
the command properly. The response of the Provider side can be observed on
the prompt.

- You can execute this sample with the following procedures.
-- Start RTSystemEditor.
-- Run MyServiceConsumer and MyServiceProvider, then each sample component
starts.The start of the component is different according to OS and the
edition of OpenRTM-aist. Please refer to the following tables.
|LEFT:40|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|LEFT:120|c

-- Both components are displayed on NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor. To
add a RTcomponent to the System Editor from the Name Service View into the
System Editor.
-- Drag and drop between two ports to connect them.
-- RTcomponents Activate.
-- Input command Consumer
-- The input command and values of MyServiceConsumer are displayed in
MyServiceProvider screen.
