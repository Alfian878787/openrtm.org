When loading a locally-stored specification file, the absolute path will be displayed at the top level of the tree hierarchy. The second level will display the category specified by the component in the file. The third level will display the name of the component contained in the file.

//If the path of the loaded file already exists in the Repository View, the new component will be added below the existing path entry. The same applies if the category also already exists.

****Loading directories 
All components in a directory can be loaded in a single action. Right-click in the Repository View and select ''Load Dir'' from the context menu. A directory selector dialog will be displayed. Select a directory to load. All components in that directory will be loaded into the Repository View and displayed as with loading individual files.

When deleting a top-level path, all categories and components below that path are deleted at the same time. If a component is deleted, and there are no more components in the same category, that category will be deleted. If there are no other categories, the top-level directory will also be deleted.
