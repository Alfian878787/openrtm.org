**What is the RtcTemplate? 
RtcTemplate is a development tool that generates templates for RT-&color(default){Component};. It has the functions to generate RT-&color(default){Component}; templates based on parameters. Also, RtcTemplate that can run on Eclipse, enable an intuitive operation and allow seamless collaboration with other Eclipse plug-ins.~
While RtcTemplate can run even without RtcLink, RtcTemplate and its menu are integrated when RtcLink has been installed. This manual assumes that RtcLink has already been installed.


**Installation of RtcTemplate 
Since RtcTemplate is an Eclipse plug-in, you need to install Eclipse. Also, you need to install the Java Runtime Environment before installing Eclipse because Eclipse is a Java application itself. Moreover, when you install RtcTemplate, you would be better to install RtcLink.

***Installing Java Runtime Environment 
Please refer to [[Installing Java Runtime Environment:/en/node/724#instJRE]] in "Installation of RtcLink".

***Installing Eclipse 
Please refer to [[Installing Eclipse:/en/node/724#insteclipse]] in "Installation of RtcLink".
***Installing and launching RtcTemplate
You download [[Plug-in of RtcTemplate (RtcTemplate on Eclipse):/en/node/531]], and copy the &color(default){downloaded}; jar file to the Eclipse plug-in directory (the directory named plugins under the eclipse directory).

You launch Eclipse and RtcLink in order, and the RtcTemplate editor starts by pushing [Open New RtcTemplate Editor] button of the toolbar or by selecting [File]-[Open New Template Editor] of the menu bar.
