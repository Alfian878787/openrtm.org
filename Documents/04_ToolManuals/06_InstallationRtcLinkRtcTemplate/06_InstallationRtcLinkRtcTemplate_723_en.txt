**What is the RtcLink? 
RtcLink is a GUI tool to operate RT-Components that exist on the network. It can activate and deactivate RT-Components (Activate/Deactivate) or connect between their ports.

RtcLink, included in OpenRTM-aist-0.2.0 as a system development tool, was implemented with the toolkit named wxPython.
In OpenRTM-aist-0.4.0, this was reimplemented as a plug-in of the integrated development environment platform Eclipse.

**What is the RtcTemplate?
RtcTemplate is a development tool that generates templates for RT-Component. It has the functions to generate RT-Component templates based on parameters. Also, RtcTemplate that can run on Eclipse, enable an intuitive operation and allow seamless collaboration with other Eclipse plug-ins.~ While RtcTemplate can run even without RtcLink, RtcTemplate and its menu are integrated when RtcLink has been installed. This manual assumes that RtcLink has already been installed.

**About Eclipse
[[Eclipse>http://www.eclipse.org/]] is an open-source software framework to construct the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java as well as other languages.
The basic part of Eclipse is a platform to execute plug-ins, and various development environments are constructed as an aggregation of plug-ins. 
Java development environment included Eclipse by default is also implemented as plug-ins, and Eclipse can be extended easily as the development environment for various languages by adding plug-ins.

The features of Eclipse are:
- It is easily extensible by plug-in mechanism, and also possible to collaborate between plug-ins.
- It can be facilitated to make plug-in a standalone by the mechanism called Rich Client Platform (RCP).
- It can run on a lot of platforms because it is implemented by Java. etc.

We thought these features of Eclipse were useful to construct the integrated development environment for robots, and selected Eclipse as a platform for the RT middleware tool.

To use RtcLink, you have to install Eclipse. For more details on how to install Eclipse, please refer to:
