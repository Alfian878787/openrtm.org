**Installation of RtcLink
RtcLink is an Eclipse Plug-in, so you need to install Eclipse. Also, Eclipse is a Java application itself, so you need to install Java Runtime Environment (or JDK:Java Development Kit) before you install Eclipse.

***Installing Java Runtime Environment&aname(instJRE);
Eclipse is a Java application, so you need to install a Java Runtime Environment [[(JRE)>http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]].

-[[JRE Download>http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp]]
-[[JRE (Windows) On-line Installer>http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=11145]]
-[[JRE (Windows) Off-line Installer>http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=11193]]

After the download, please install JRE by following the installation procedure. 

&br;&color(red){Additional Notes:};

On FedoraCore, if you install java with yam, GCJ (The GNU Compiler for Java) is automatically installed, which may cause errors in NameService View of RtcLink by using that GCJ.
&br;When such a error occurs, please check that Java of Sun Microsystems is used.
&br;If you want to use Java of Sun only on Eclipse, please copy the jre directory that was created by downloading and running jdk-xxx-linux-i586.bin to the Eclipse installation directory.

 $ sh jdk-6u4-linux-i586.bin
 $ cp -r jdk1.6.0_04/jre eclipse/

(You seem to be able to select Java by using JPackage, alternatives.)

***Installing Eclipse&aname(insteclipse);
Please download and install the appropriate archive file of Eclipse for your environment from [[the download page>http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php]]. 
We recommend versions of Eclipse 3.1.1 or 3.2 to use RtcLink.

''Update!''
''The package for Windows including Eclipse3.2, Localizing Eclipse into Japanese, RtcLink, GEF, EMF and RtcTemplate is available [[here>RtcLink/RtcTemplate_en]].'' Please use this package if you would like to run it as soon as possible. You can install it very easily.

****How to install Eclipse
The Eclipse archive file (the compressed package file) is more than 100MB in size. After downloading it, please extract it to the directory you would like to install it. 
Eclipse does not need an installer, and you can run it by simply extracting it.

***Localizing Eclipse into Japanese 
Currently, Eclipse is not localized into Japanese. If you want to localize Eclipse into Japanese, please refere to the following web site. 
-[[Localizing Eclipse into Japanese>http://eclipsewiki.net/eclipse/?%C6%FC%CB%DC%B8%EC%B2%BD]]

The simple procedures are as follows.

-Download the file from the following URLs.
--[[NLpack1-eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-win32.zip>http://www.ring.gr.jp/pub/misc/eclipse/downloads/drops/L-3.1.1_Language_Packs-200510051300/NLpack1-eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-win32.zip]]
--[[NLpack1-eclipse-SDK-3.2-win32.zip>http://www.ring.gr.jp/pub/misc/eclipse/downloads/drops/L-3.2_Language_Packs-200607121700/NLpack1-eclipse-SDK-3.2-win32.zip]]
-Copy the features and the plugins in the eclipse folder created by extracting to the Eclipse install directory.
-Restart Eclipse.

***Installing and Launching RtcLink 
In RtcLink, the following Eclipse plug-ins are used.
-[[EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework)>http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/]]
-[[GEF (Graphical Editing Framework)>http://www.eclipse.org/gef/]] 

Before installing RtcLink plug-in, please install these plug-ins.

First, select [''help(H)'']-[''Software Updates(S)'']-[''Find and install...''] from the menu of Eclipse.
Installation/update wizard is displayed.

and then push [''Next(N)''].
These plug-ins are automatically downloaded and installed.
After installing, exit Eclipse once.

Next, download [[Plug-in of RtcLink on Eclipse >/en/node/531]] , and copy the downloaded jar file to the Eclipse plug-in directory (the directory named "plugins" that under the eclipse directory usually created when the Eclipse archive is extracted).

Launch Eclipse and select [''Window(W)'']-[''Open Perspective'']-[''Other(O)''] from the menu, and then the following perspective selection dialog appears.

Select RtcLink from the list of perspectives, then the next screen is shown and RtcLink begins to work.
#br

#ref(EclipsePluginInstall5.png,nolink,center)

When RtcLink doesn't appear in the perspective list, please make sure again EMF and GEF are installed correctly, and RtcLink is copied correctly in the plug-in directory.
