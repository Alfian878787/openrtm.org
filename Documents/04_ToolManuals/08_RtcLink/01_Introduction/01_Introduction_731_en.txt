***Procedures of System Construction using RtcLink
Procedures to construct systems using RtcLink are in general as follows:

:''1.Launch components''|Start RT-Components which are required by the system.
Normally, the RT-Components are launched after specifying one name server for the entire system.

:''2.Connect RtcLink to the name server''|Launch RtcLink and connect it to the name server which was specified when the RT-Components are launched, on NameServiceView.

:''3.Edit on the system editor''|You can see the running RT-Components, which have been registered in the name server, on NameServiceView of RtcLink.
Drag these to the system editor, and connect appropriate ports on them each other using  RtcLink.

:''4.Launch(Activate) of components''|Once you have connected between RT-Components, activate the RT-Components and launch the system.
You can activate RT-Components one by one, or activate them altogether using the [All Activate] button on the menu button.
:''5.Save System''|You can save your system as a XML file, which include the information of connection and so on.
:''6.Restore System''|Load the saved file of system configuration information, restore its connection information, and launch the system as before.


Besides these usages, you can use it for debugging RT-Components which you have built.
