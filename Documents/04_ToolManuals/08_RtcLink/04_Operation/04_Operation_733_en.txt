**Changing State of RT-Component
On the system editor, you can select a RT-Component and perform [''Activate''], [''Deactivate''], [''Reset''], [''Finalize''], [''Exit''], [''Start''] and [''Stop''].
You can also perform the same operations on the name service view.

#br

CENTER:''Changing state on the name service view(left) and the system editor(right)''
#br

These actions mean:

|Action name|Target|Meaning|
|Activate|First ExecutionContext|Activate|
|Deactivate|~|Deactivate|
|Reset|~|Reset|
|Finalize|RT-Component|Finalize|
|Exit|~|Exit|
|Start|First ExecutionContext|Start|
|Stop|~|Stop|

From the toolbar and the context menu, you can perform [''Activate''], [''Deactivate''], [''Start''] and [''Stop''] for all RT-Components included in the system editor.
#br

#ref(rtc-link34.png,nolink,center)
CENTER:''Toolbar buttons:operatable for all components together''
#br

Actions targeted for all components are applied to not only the 1st ExecutionContext but also all. 
Notice that the result of actions such as [''Activate''] and [''Start''] differs when they are applied to a RT-Component in the window one by one.

**Connecting Ports 
On the system editor, you can connect ports of RT-Components.
To connect ports, connect the ports by drag and drop.
#br

#ref(rtc-link35.png,nolink,center)
#br

After drag and drop, a dialog which you enter the required information for the connection pops up.
#br

#ref(rtc-link36.png,nolink,center)
#br

In this dialog, create ConnectorProfile.
ConnectorProfile needs to satisfy the conditions each port requires.This dialog only allows values which satisfy the conditions.

For a connection which required conditions cannot be satisfied, when you drag and drop, a prohibition mark us shown, so you cannot connect them.
#br

#ref(rtc-link37.png,nolink,center) 
#br

Connection between ports have two kinds: data ports and service ports.

**Data Ports Connection
To connect data ports, connect "InPort" and "OutPort". When you drag and drop between them, the next dialog is shown.
#br

#ref(rtc-link38.png,nolink,center)
#br

Here is the items and conditions of this dialog:

|Item|Profile Name|Summary|
|Data Type|''dataport.data_type''|Data type used by the port.|
|Interface Type|''dataport.interface_type''|Interface type used by the data port. Only CORBA_Any is available in default.|
|Dataflow Type|''dataport.dataflow_type''|Dataflow type. Select Push or Pull type.|
|Subscription Type|''dataport.subscription_type''|Subscription type. It has meaning only in Push type. Select New, Periodic, or Flush type.|
|Push Rate(Hz)|''dataport.push_interval''|Cycle of sending data when Subscription Type is Periodic. This is availabl only when Subscription Type is ''Periodic''.|

For these items, RtcLink generates specifiable values by string matching from value list of each port.
Therefore, it cannot decide inputable values in such a case when only ANY is specified in both ports.
When both ports have ANY in their value list, RtcLink allows you to input any string.
Items that can take any input of character strings are shown "Any Input".

**Service Ports Connection 
To connect service ports, connect "''ServicePort''" and "''ServicePort''". 
When you drag and drop to connect between them, the next dialog is shown. 

#br

#ref(rtc-link39.png,nolink,center)
#br

In the case of the service port, there are no required conditions for the connection.
However when each PortInterfaceProfile is not matched perfectly between the ServicePorts, a warning is shown in the connection dialog.
The perfect matching means both PortInterfaceProfiles have the same "type" and their polarities consist of PROVIDED and REQUIRED respectively.
In addition, all PortInterfaceProfiles need to be matched completey (There are multiple PortInterfaceProfiles on each port). 

**Disconnecting Ports 
To disconnect ports, select a connection and press [Delete] button, or select Delete from the context menu.

**Saving Your System
You can save your system which you have constructed on the system editor.
To save it, click [''File''] menu or right-click in the editor, then select [''Save...''].
(You can choose an appropriate file by [''SaveAs...''].) 

#br

***Opening Your Saved System 
To open your saved system, right-click in the editor and select [Open].
#br

#ref(rtc-link42.png,nolink,center)
#br

Once you opened it, RtcLink refresh to the latest information based on the remote system.
To restore your saved contents to the system, use [Open and Restore...] which we describe at the next section.

**Opening and Restoring Your Saved System 
To open and restore your saved system, right-click in the editor and select [Open and Restore...].
#br

#ref(rtc-link43.png,nolink,center) 
#br

RtcLink restore those contents to the system:
-Connection between ports
-Configuration information

When it fails to restore, error messages are shown.
Even when errors occur, RtcLink tries to restore as possible as it can.

**Restoring Your Saved System (Console)
RtcLink has a feature to restore a system from a console instead by GUI.To restore from a console, execute "run.bat" in "ConsoleRestore" folder of RtcLink Console Restore package which is distributed separately, with your saved file.

 C:\tmp\RtcLink\ConsoleRestore > run.bat C:\tmp\save.rtclink
