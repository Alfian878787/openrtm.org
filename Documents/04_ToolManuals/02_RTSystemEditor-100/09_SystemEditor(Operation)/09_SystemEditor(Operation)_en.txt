The meaning of these actions is described below.

|Action Name|target|meaning|
|Activate|Begin executing the selected RTC using the first ExecutionContext|Enter the Active state|
|Deactivate|~|Enter the Deactivate state|
|Reset|~|Enter the Reset state|
|Finalize|Selected RTC is executed|Enter the Finalize state|
|Exit|~|Enter the Exit state|
|Start|Begin executing the selected RTC using the first ExecutionContext|Enter the Start state|
|Stop|~|Enter the Activate state|

In addition, in order to easily manage an entire system, the System Editor allows all contained components to be activated, deactivated, started and stopped at once using buttons in the tool bar or the context menu.

Using the "All" actions, ExecutionContexts other than the first can also be used. The result may differ from controlling each component individually.

***Connecting Ports 
The System Editor can be used to connect ports. Drag and drop between two ports to connect them.
#br

CENTER:''Connecting two ports''
#br
After dragging and dropping, a dialog will be displayed requesting the necessary information for the connection.
#br


#ref(fig27ConnectorProfileDialog_en.png,60%,center)
CENTER:''Connector Profile dialog''
#br
This dialog is used to build a Connector Profile. The Connector Profile must meet the various conditions of the ports. This dialog only allows information that meets these conditions to be entered. If two ports cannot be connected due to conflicting conditions, this is indicated when attempting to drag a connetion between them.

Port connections are broadly divided into data port connections and service port connections.
