The following items are restored:

-Configuration information&br;
~At restoration time, it will try to search for name servers and retrieve remote components using the component path ID. If ''Quick Restore'' is selected, it will first try using the IOR stored in the profile, and only if that fails will it attempt to access a name server.
When restoration fails, the error details are displayed. RT System Editor will attempt to restore as much as possible.
