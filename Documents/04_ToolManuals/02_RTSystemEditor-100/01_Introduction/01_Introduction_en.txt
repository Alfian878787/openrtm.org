**Introduction 
*** OpenRTM-aist RT System Editor Introduction 
The [[OMG:http://www.omg.org]] has developed the Robot Technology Component (RTC) specification as a way to increase the efficiency of robot development. Based on this specification, AIST has developed the [[OpenRTM-aist:http://openrtm.a01.aist.go.jp/~n-ando/OpenRTM-aist/]]. RT System Editor is one of the development tools included in this architecture. It is used for manipulating RT Components in a real-time graphical interface. It is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, and interacts seamlessly with other Eclipse plugins.

***Target Audience 
This document is targetted at those who already have an understanding of the basic principles of RT Components. Details of the RTC specification and use can be found at the [[OMG:http://www.omg.org/]] and [[AIST:http://openrtm.a01.aist.go.jp/~n-ando/OpenRTM-aist/]].

CENTER:''Functionality''
|Functionality|Overview|
|Display/edit component configuration|Display the configuration profile of the selected component in the configuration view and allow it to be edited.|
|Change component action|Change the action of the selected component.|
|Combine components|Create a system by combining components in the editor.|
|System save/load|Save the contents of the system editor as an RTS Profile. Load RTS Profiles into the system editor. (Does not change port connections or configuration parameters.)|
|System reset|Open an RTS Profile using the system editor, and have the system restored based on the profile contents. (Restores port connections and configuration parameters as well.)|

**Operating Environment 
The following software is required to use RT System Editor.
