*** Data port connections

Data port connections connect an Inport and an OutPort. The following dialog is displayed when creating this type of connection.

|áÇ|Item|Connector Profile|Conditions|
|á@|Name|name|None|
|áA|Data Type|properties Ågdataport.data_typeÅh|Type of data to be transmitted between the ports connected by this connector. Select from the types suported by all ports involved. When Any is included, anything is permitted.|
|áB|Instance Type|properties Ågdataport.interface_typeÅh|The interface type specified by the RT system designer or the RT Middleware on which the RTC is executing. Select from the types supported by all ports involved. When Any is included, anything is permitted.|
|áC|Dataflow Type|properties Ågdataport.dataflow_typeÅh|The data flow type specified by the RT system designer or the RT Middleware on which the RTC is executing. Select from the types supported by all ports involved. When Any is included, anything is permitted.|
|áD|Subscription Type|properties Ågdataport.subscription_typeÅh|Required when the Dataflow Type is "Push." The subscription type specified by the RT system designer or the RT Middleware on which the RTC is executing. Select from the types supported by all ports involved. When Any is included, anything is permitted.|
|áE|Push Rate(Hz)|properties Ågdataport.push_intervalÅh|Required when the Dataflow Type is "Push" or the Subscription Type is "Periodic." Specifies the transmission frequency when the subscription type is periodic. Must be a number.|
~For items áA-áD, the values allowed by RT System Editor are generated by matching character strings from the port lists. Because of this, when both ports only list ANY, it cannot determine the permissable values. For this reason, RT System Editor allows character string entry when both ports only list ANY. When this is possible, it is indicated in the dialog.

*** Service port connections

A service port connection is between two ServicePorts. The following dialog is displayed when creating this type of connection.

|áÇ|Item|Connector Profile|Conditions|
|á@|Name|Name|None|
#br
There are no required conditions when connecting service ports. However, if the PortInterfaceProfile between two ServicePorts does not completely match*, a warning will be displayed in the Connector Profile dialog.

CENTER:''Service port connector dialog error''

~''*'' "Completely match" means the PortInterfaceProfile "type" is the same and the polarity is PROVIDED and REQUIRED, respectively. 
&color(red){''Note''};'' When there are multiple connections between the same ports, the connection lines will not be differentiated.''
