|‡‚|Dialog name|Description|
|‡@|Manager|Select a manager from those displayed in the name service view. The composite component will be created in that manager.|
|‡A|Name|Instance name of the composite component.|
|‡B|Type|Set the type of the component. The following types are available: &br;PeriodicECShared&br;All RTCs will only share the execution context. The individual RTCs will have separate state, allowing multiple states to exist within a single composite component.&br;PeriodicStateShared&br;As well as sharing an execution context, the components will also share state.&br;Grouping&br;Nothing will be shared betweeen child components.|
|‡C|Path|Path setting for the composite component.|
|‡D|Port|Select which ports of the child components will be proxied to the composite component, making them accessible from outside the composite component.|
|‡E|-|Select or deselect all ports.|

When creating a composite component, the child components that were selected in the system editor will disappear and a new composite component will take their place. Double-click on this new component, or right-click on it and select ''Open with System Diagram Editor'' to open the component's internals in a new system editor.

When saving the system structure, only one component diagram can be saved. Because of this, when displaying the internals of a composite component, any changes to the component diagram will not be saved.
#br

***Add Child Component
Open the composite component in a system editor and drag components from the name server view into it to add them as child components. Newly-added components start with all their ports private.

***Delete Child Component 
Open the composite component in a system editor and delete the unwanted child component. The child component will be removed from the composite component and displayed in the system diagram in which the composite component itself is displayed.

***Deleting a Composite Component 
Right-click on the composite component and select ''Delete'' to remove the composite component from the diagram. If the component is open in another system diagram, a warning dialog will be displayed.

***Decomposing a Composite Component
Right-click on the composite component and select ''Decompose Composite Component''. exit() will be sent to the component and the component will terminate. If the component is open in another system diagram, a warning will be displayed. The child components will be displayed in the system diagram in which the composite component was displayed.

***Changing ports between public and private 
When editing the internals of a composite component, the public ports of child components will be displayed using the following symbols.

|InPort|

To make a port private, right-click on it and select ''Unexport''. To make a port public, right-click on it and select ''Export''.

If a port is connected to another component, it cannot be made private until it is disconnected.
