OpenRTM-aist is a software platform for component-oriented development of robot systems.

OpenRTM-aist builds a system by creating a program for each functional element (this is called RT component: RTC) and connecting the RT components when building the robot system. The RT component can be developed in ''C++'', ''Python'', ''Java'' language and supports major OS (Linux / Unix, Windows, Mac OS X). Eclipse tool and command line tool can be used for component development and system development using components.

The RT component has functions called ports for exchanging data and commands with other components, basic state transitions called activities for unifying behaviors, and functions that can externally manipulate parameters It is equipped. By using these functions, you can easily create modules with high independence and reusability. By using someone's components already, you can build a system with just the minimum programming.

OpenRTM-aist is implemented using CORBA, distributed object middleware, with emphasis on network transparency, OS independence, and language independence. Currently, OpenRTM-aist provides implementations for C++ and Python languages.
