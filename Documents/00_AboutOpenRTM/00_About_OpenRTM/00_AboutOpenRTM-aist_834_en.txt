OpenRTM-aist is a software platform to develop the robotic system in
component-oriented.

In OpenRTM-aist, the robot system system can be constructed by making the
program of each functional element (This is called RT-Component:RTC), and
connecting those RT-Components. The RT component can develop in ''C++'',
''Python'', and ''Java'' language, and supports main OS(Linux/Unix, Windows,
Mac OS X).''Eclipse'' tools and the tool of the command line can be used for
the component development and the system development using the component. 

Some functions are equipped in RT-Component. 
-Function that is called port to exchange data and command with other components
-Basic state transition that is called activity to unite behavior
-Function of configuration that can operate parameter from the outside

A module that becomes independent, recycles, and is high can be easily made
by using these functions. You can construct the system only with making a
minimum programming by using the component that someone made. 


OpenRTM-aist is implemented by using CORBA that is the distributed object
middleware because the network permeability, OS non-dependency, and language
independence are valued.
