** FAQ 
*** The performance of RT System Editor is slow.
''A.'' RT System Editor is constantly gathering information about the system. If a registered object does not exist, it must wait for a timeout. This can cause a large slowdown. Objects that do not exist should be deleted from the Name Service View, as well as any connections to other objects. This should restore performance.

*** A project called "RT System Editor_Files" has been created in the Eclipse workspace. What is it? 
''A.'' RT System Editor stores temporary information at runtime in these files. Do not delete them while RT System Editor is running. When RT System Editor is stopped, it is safe to delete them.

*** The Name Service View performance is bad 
''A.'' The Name Service View is constantly gathering information about objects registered with the name servers. If a registered object does not exist, it must wait for a timeout. This can cause a large slowdown. Objects that do not exist should be deleted from the Name Service View, as well as any connections to other objects. This should restore performance.

*** There are duplicate connections between two ports in the System Editor. How can I tell them apart? 
''A.'' It is not possible to tell many connections apart. Check using the project file.
