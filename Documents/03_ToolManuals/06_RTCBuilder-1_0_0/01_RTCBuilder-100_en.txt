RTC Builder is a template generator tool for RT Components. It generates custom templates based on user-configured parameters. RTC Builder operates on top of Eclipse and interacts seamlessly and intuitively with other Eclipse plugins. Although RTC Builder can be used even if RT System Editor is not installed, if it is, RTC Builder's menus will be integrated with those of RT System Editor. This document is written assuming RT System Editor is installed.
