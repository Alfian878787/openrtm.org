**Installing and Starting RT System Editor 

*** Installing RT System Editor 
Because RT System Editor is an Eclipse plugin, it first requires that Eclipse and the other Eclipse plugins it depends on be installed. See the [[installation instructions>Functionality Outline/Operating Environment]] for details on how to do this. Then copy the RT System Editor jar file (jp.go.aist.rtm.X.X.X.jar) into the eclipse/plugins directory as described in that document.

*** Starting RT System Editor 
The first time Eclipse is started after installing, the Welcome page will be displayed.
