Anything entered in this tab will be saved only if the component is saved while this tab is visible. If, after editing the XML in this tab, another tab is opened and the component is saved, the values from that tab will take precedence. All changes made to the XML in this tab must follow the RTC.xml scheema. The contents will be validated when saved. If validation follows, an error similar to that shown below will appear. Fix the error and try saving again.
