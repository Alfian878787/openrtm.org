// Title: rtshell

**Introduction

rtshell provides commands used to manage individual RT components and
managers, as well as complete RT Systems. It can be used with the
OpenRTM-aist middleware or middlewares that use a compatible CORBA-based
introspection system.

Many of the commands allow components and managers to run on
nameservers to be treated like a file system. Directories can be
entered, components can be cat'd and activated/deactivated/reset,
connections made and removed, and so on.

Other commands are used in conjunction with RtsProfile XML/YAML files to
manage complete RT Systems. These are rtresurrect, rtteardown, rtcryo,
rtstart and rtstop.

The commands are aimed at users of OpenRTM-aist who wish to manage
components on low-resource systems, systems where a GUI is not available
(particularly where no network connection is available to manage
components from another computer), as well as those who face other
difficulties using RTSystemEditor.  Being familiar with using a
command-line is a benefit when using these commands of rtshell. Also, it is used to control the RT system by script like some shell script.

** Requirements
- rtctree is required.
- rtsprofile is required.
- Python 2.7 is required.
- OpenRTM - Python - 1.0.0 or higher is required for rtprint, rtinject and rtlog.
- omniORB-py 4.x or higher is required.
- For installation from source, Sphinx is required to compile the document.

// When installing by pip, rtctree and rtsprofile are automatically installed.

//omniORB-py 4.x is required.

//rtshell requires rtctree. It must be installed for the commands to function.

//The commands that work with RtsProfile files require rtsprofile. It must be
//installed for these commands to function/

//rtshell requires Python 2.7. It will not function with an earlier version of
//Python. It has not been tested with Python 3 and it is likely that several
//changes will be necessary to make it function using this version of Python.

//rtprint, rtinject and rtlog require the Python version of OpenRTM-aist.

//Sphinx must be installed to build the documentation, if installing from source
//(method 2).

//If rtshell is installed using pip (method 1, below), rtctree and rtsprofile
//will be installed automatically. omniORB-py and OpenRTM-python must still be
//installed manually.


** Installation
Please refer to the [[Install rtshell>/node/7002]] page for the installation method.

**Repository

The latest source is stored in a Git repository at github, available at http://github.com/OpenRTM/rtshell. 
You can download from the link "Download ZIP" on that page. Alternatively, use Git to clone the repository. 
//This is better if you wish to contribute patches:

 $ git clone git://github.com/OpenRTM/rtshell.git


**Documentation


The documentation is provided as a man page on Linux and is installed in ''/usr/local/share/man''. In the case of Windows, it is provided by HTML format files and the English and Japanese versions are copied under the ''en'' and ''ja'' directories under ''＜python directory＞\Lib\site-packages\rtshell\data\doc\html ''respectively. It is also posted on this website.


//Documentation is available in the form of man pages (on Windows, these are available as HTML files). 
//These will be installed under 
//${prefix}/share/man.  You must add this folder to your system's
//$MANPATH environment variable to be able to use them. For example,
//if you installed rtshell into /home/blag, add the following line to your .bashrc:

// export MANPATH=/home/blag/share/man:${MANPATH}


//**Running the tests

///The command tests can be run from the source directory using a command like the following:

// ~/src/rtshell $ ./test/test_cmds.py ~/share/OpenRTM-aist/examples/rtcs/

//The argument to the test_cmds.py command is a directory containing RTC shared libraries that can be loaded into a manager. It must contain the libraries //for Motor, Controller and Sensor.
//
//An individual command's tests can be run by specifying those tests after the command. For example:
//
// $ ./test/test_cmds.py ~/share/OpenRTM-aist/examples/rtcs/ rtactTests
//
//This will run only the tests for the rtact command.
