#ref(windows_logo.png,80%,around,nolink,right)
An MSI installer package for Windows is provided at OpenRTM.org. This installs OpenRTM-aist as well as its dependencies, such as omniORB, and related tools, such as RTSystemEditor.

**Installation by msi package

Download the msi package from [[download site:/en/node/6034]] of openrtm.org]. Python, PyYAML, CMake, Doxygen are also necessary, please install. & br;
Visual Studio is required to develop components. You can download the free version from [[this page:https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/]].

From version 1.1.2, all 3 languages (C++, Java, Python) + tools (Eclipse + rtshell) are bundled with one Windows installer. It is recommended that you uninstall older versions beforehand.
Also, please see the notation of deficit notation in [[download site:/en/node/6034]].


//Download the MSI package from the openrtm.org download site. All necessary files are included in the package, so no additional installers are necessary. However, for developing components, the following are recommended:
//-Visual C++ or Visual Studio
//-Python
//-An Eclipse package including RTSystemEditor and RTCBUilder
//-OpenCV 1.0 or 2.x (for running the sample components that use cameras.)
//We recommend uninstalling previous versions of OpenRTM-aist, omniORB, etc. before installation.

*** Invoking the installer

For the procedure, please read [[Let's start OpenRTM-aist in 10 minutes!:/en/node/6140]] page.&br;
//If you are using the 1.1.1 version, [[OpenRTM-aist in 10 minutes! (OpenRTM - aist 1.1.1): / en / node / 5710]] page.&br;
//If you are using version 1.0.0, [[OpenRTM-aist in 10 minutes! (OpenRTM - aist 1.0.0): / en / node / 850]] page.

** Installation details
*** Work contents of installer

- Copy various files to the installation directory (default is C:\Program Files)
// - Copy OpenRTM-aist header, script, library, and sample to OpenRTM-aist \ <version_number> or less
// - Copy standalone version RTSystemEditor and OpenRTP according to selection of installer option
// - Copy OpenJDK JRE according to selection of installer option
// - Copy omniORB header, libraries, commands etc to omniORB or less
// - Copy the Visual C ++ runtime to the system directory
- Start Menu Create an OpenRTM-aist folder below and set various shortcuts
// - Create shortcuts for rtcd, name servers, etc.
// - Create shortcut for sample RTC
// - create class reference by doxygen, create IDL reference shortcut
- Setting environment variables

We provide a script to check the setting of the installation environment. We will explain how to use the script and what you can check on the following page.

*** Files to be installed
The file is installed with the following structure. &br;
Executing [[script:/en/node/6092]] to check the setting of the above installation environment saves the directory structure under OpenRTM-aist by the tree command in the log file, so you can check the details I can do it.
