// Title: Installing RTCBuilder
#contents
**RTCBuilder
RTCBuilder is a template generator tool for RT Components. It generates custom templates based on user-configured parameters. RTCBuilder operates on top of Eclipse and interacts seamlessly and intuitively with other Eclipse plugins. Although RTCBuilder can be used even if RTSystemEditor is not installed, if it is, RTCBuilder's menus will be integrated with those of RTSystemEditor. This document is written assuming RTSystemEditor is installed.

**Install RTCBuilder 
Because RTCBuilder is an Eclipse plugin, it requires Eclipse to be installed. Eclipse is written in Java, so it in turn requires a Java environment to be set up before it can be installed (such as the JDK).
- Please refer to [["Installation of Java execution environment (JRE) of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#jre_install]] for the installation of the Java execution environment. 
-Please refer to [["Installation of Eclipse of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#eclipse_install]] for the installation of Eclipse.  

*** Installing and Starting RTCBuilder 
Download the [[RTCBuilder plugin:/en/node/529]] and copy the jar files into the Eclipse plugin directory. This is a directory called plugin below the'eclipse directory in the location you extracted the Eclipse archive to.  Start Eclipse and select [Open Perspective] > [Other] from the Window menu. The perspective selection dialog will be displayed.
