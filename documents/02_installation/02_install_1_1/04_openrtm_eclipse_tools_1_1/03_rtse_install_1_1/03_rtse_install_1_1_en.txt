**Installing RTSystemEditor
Because RTSystemEditor is an Eclipse plugin, it requires Eclipse to be installed. Eclipse is written in Java, so it in turn requires a Java environment to be set up before it can be installed (such as the JDK).

-Please refer to [["Installation of Java execution environment (JRE) of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#jre_install]] for the installation of the Java execution environment. 
-Please refer to [["Installation of Eclipse of Eclipse":/en/node/1418#eclipse_install]] for the installation of Eclipse.  

****Installation 

*** Installing RT System Editor 
Start Eclipse and select ''Open Perspective''->''Other'' from the ''Window'' menu. The perspective selection dialog will be displayed.

If RTSystemEditor is not available in the list of perspectives, check that EMF, GEF and XSD are all correctly installed, and that the RTSystemEditor plugin is in the correct directory.

***Restart Eclipse 

After confirming that RTSystemEditor starts, restart Eclipse using the same workspace. RTSystemEditor should be displayed as it was when you exited Eclipse.
