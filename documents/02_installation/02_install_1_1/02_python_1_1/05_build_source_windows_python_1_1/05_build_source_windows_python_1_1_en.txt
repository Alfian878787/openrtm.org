// Title: Building from source in Windows
#contents

For those who wish to install from a source package, it is possible to build OpenRTM-aist-python manually.

**Source code for Windows

The OpenRTM-aist (Python version) source package for Windows is distributed separately from the source for Linux.
The contents of the source code are exactly the same but the following parts are different.

- Character code (Windows: Shift-JIS, Linux: EUC)

//The Windows source code for the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist is distributed separately from the source code for Linux. The source is entirely the same, but the character sets are different. The Windows source uses Shift-JIS while the Linux source uses EUC.

***Source code organisation
Original is source code of subversion repository, from its source code, on Linux,

- Source code distribution package for Linux/Unix
- Source code distribution package for Windows

Two types,

On Windows,

- Source code distribution package for Windows

It is configured to create only one type of.

//The original code is stored in a Subversion repository. The Windows and Linux source packages are built from this in Linux. The Windows source package is also built on Windows.

**Build environment

The necessary tools and libraries for building are:

-Python
-omniORBpy

*** Python
Python 2.7 is required. Please obtain the latest version from the following site and install it.

- [[Python Official Website:https://www.python.org/]]

When launching the installer, there are some parts to select in the wizard,
You can install by default.

//Download the latest 2.x Python from this site and install it.
//-[[Python Official Website:http://www.python.org/]]
//The installation package presents several options. The defaults are suitable.

*** omniORBpy

The omniORBpy library is necessary to build the Python edition of OpenRTM-aist. omniORBpy can be obtained from the link below. Source packages and binaries are available. However, openrtm.org provides a pre-built binary installer that may be more convenient.

-[[omniORB official:http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/]]
--[[sourceforge download page:https://sourceforge.net/projects/omniorb/files/omniORBpy/]]
//-[[MSI package provided by openrtm.org:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/Windows/omniORB/]]
//--The omniORBpy installers are separated by Python version. Be sure to use an installer matching your Python version.

When you unzip the ZIP file, the directory tree shown below should be expanded.
Please place the files under each directory in the Python directory as indicated below.
The version of omniORBpy is described as x.y, and the version of Python as X.Y.

 + omniPRBpy-x.y
  + bin
    + x86_win32 -> both exe and dll go directly under C:\PythonXY
  + doc -> may be deleted
  + examples -> may be deleted
  + idl -> may be deleted but it may be placed under C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages\omniORB\idl
  + lib
    + python -> directly below C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages directory and files
    + x86_win32 -> .pyd directly under C:\PythonXY\Lib\site-packages

** Obtaining a source package.

Download a source package, named OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.zip, and extract it in a suitable directory.

-[[OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.1.2:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/python/1.1.2/]]
-[[OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.1.0:http://www.openrtm.org/pub/OpenRTM-aist/python/1.1.0/]]

** Build

Start a command prompt and change to the directory where you extracted the source code. Execute the following commands.

 > OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X
 > python setup.py build

** Install

Once everything has built successfully, execute the following command to install it.

 > python setup.py install

This completes the installation of OpenRTM-aist.
