This sample is included with the C++, Python and the Java editions of OpenRTM-aist.

**Introduction

This sample shows how to use configuration sets for RT-Components. When you launch the ConfigSample component, its configuration set is set up automatically. You can check and alter the configuration using RTSystemEditor.

Note: If an error "Specified path cannot be found" occurs, modify the value of "example.ConfigSample.config_file" in rtc.conf file under the RTMExamples\ConfigSample directory. Change it to:

 .\\RTMExamples\\ConfigSample\\configsample.conf
 (Use '\\' instead of '\' for the separator between file name and directory names. )

or rewrite it to the full path of "configsample.conf". In this case, you need to specify '\\' as a directory separator, as well.
