Each port of the component transmits input data by turning on the check box on the GUI
after it is connected to a corresponding port. Use another sample component,
such as SeqIn, for displaying the output.

The relationship between each GUI element and the ports is as follows:
:Slider(Upper)|TimedLong
:Text box(Middle)|TimedString
:Spinner (Lower)|TimedDouble

**Running the sample

The value received by the output component changes by operating the controls in
the GUIIn component.

-Start RTSystemEditor.
-Run GUIIn and SeqIn. Starting the components differs by operating system. Use
GUIIn.bat on Windows and GUIIn.sh on Linux.
-Both components are displayed in the name service view of RTSystemEditor. Add
the components to the System Editor.
-Drag and drop between the two ports to connect them.
-Activate the components.
