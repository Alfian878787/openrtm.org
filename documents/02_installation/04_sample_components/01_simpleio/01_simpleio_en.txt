*** How to use
The sample of SimpleIO is a sample that sends the number input by ConsoleIn from the data port to ConsoleOut and displays the same number on ConsoleOut side.
Enter a number from the ConsoleIn screen. Then the number entered in ConsoleOut will be output.


- Start OpenRTP and open RTSystemEditor. See [[RTSystemEditor>/node/6401]] for details on how to use RTSystemEditor
- Start both ConsoleIn and ConsoleOut components.
Component startup differs depending on the OS and OpenRTM-aist language. Start by referring to the table below.

- Drag both components onto the SystemEditor as both components appear in the NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor.
- Connect the ports of both components. (Refer to SimpleIO execution example above)
- Right-click either component and select [All Activate].
- The "Please input number:" prompt appears on the ConsoleIn screen. Enter the number.
