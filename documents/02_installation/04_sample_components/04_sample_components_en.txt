// Title: About the sample attached to OpenRTM
#contents
OpenRTM - aist comes with several sample components, which you can easily trial. (USBCameraMonitor / USBCameraAcquire component requires OpenCV.)
The source code of the sample component is also included, so please use it for development.

In this chapter, we will explain the sample attached to OpenRTM-aist. &br;
If you are going to try out the sample, please activate the name service you installed before starting each sample component.
#br

--Start Naming Service.bat (C++)
--rtc-naming.py (Python)
--start-orbd.vbs (Java)

To run the name server on Windows, double click on the corresponding file. If you installed using the installer, you can also run it from [Start Menu] > [OpenRTM-aist] > [Tools].
In this chapter, we assume that the environment where RTSystemEditor is installed is assumed.
For details on installing RTSystemEditor, see [[Installing OpenRTM Eclipse tools>/en/content/openrtm-eclipse-tools-]]. (Some samples will work without RTSystemEditor ).
