// ** OpenRTM-aist sample
OpenRTM-aist comes with some sample components that are easy to use.
(OpenCV is required for CameraViewer / OpenCVCamera components.)
Also, the source code of the sample component is included, so please refer to it for development.

This chapter describes the samples provided with OpenRTM-aist. If you want to use the sample component, start the name service before starting the sample component. The following programs are provided for the name service.

-Start Naming Service.bat (C ++)
-rtm-naming.py (Python)

To run the name server on Windows, locate the file in Explorer and double-click it. If you installed using the installer, you can also start the name service by selecting [Start Menu]> [OpenRTM-aist]> [Start Naming Service].
Note that this chapter assumes that RTSystemEditor is installed in your environment.
For details on installing RTSystemEditor, see [[Installing OpenRTP>//en/node/6944]].
