// Title: About the sample attached to OpenRTM
#contents

OpenRTM-aist comes with some sample components that are easy to use.
(OpenCV is required for CameraViewer / OpenCVCamera components.)
Also, the source code of the sample component is included, so please refer to it for development.

In this chapter, we will explain the sample attached to OpenRTM-aist. &br;
If you are going to try out the sample, please activate the name service you installed before starting each sample component.
#br

--Start Naming Service.bat (C++)
--rtc-naming.py (Python)
--start-orbd.vbs (Java)

To run the name server on Windows, locate the file in Explorer and double-click it. If you installed using the installer, you can also start the name service by selecting [Start Menu]> [OpenRTM-aist]> [Start Naming Service].
Note that this chapter assumes that RTSystemEditor is installed in your environment.
For details on installing RTSystemEditor, see [[Installing OpenRTP>//en/node/6944]].
