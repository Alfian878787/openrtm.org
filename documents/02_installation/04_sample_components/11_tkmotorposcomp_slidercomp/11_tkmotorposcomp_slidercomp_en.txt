*** How to use
Simulate the environment of controlling the rotation of the motor with the slide knob on the GUI with SliderComp and TkMotorPosComp.

- Procedure
-- Start RTSystemEditor and open a new SystemEditor. See [[RTSystemEditor>/node/6401]] for details on how to use RTSystemEditor
-- Start SliderComp.bat and TkMotorComp.bat, both components.
-- Since both components are displayed in the Name Service View of RTSystemEditor, drag them onto SystemEditor.
-- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (Refer to "SlideComp and TkMotorPosComp on RTSystemEditor" above)
-- Right-click either component and select [Activate Systems].
-- On the GUI of TkMotorComp, six models simulating a rotating disk driven by a motor are displayed and confirm that the rotation angles can be controlled by the up / down slide knobs on the GUI of SliderComp. Each GUI shows the six controlling knobs and the rotation algle of six motors.
