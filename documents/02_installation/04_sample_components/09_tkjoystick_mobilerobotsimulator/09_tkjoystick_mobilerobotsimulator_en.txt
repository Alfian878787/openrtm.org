- Procedure
-- Start RTSystemEditor and open a new SystemEditor. See [[RTSystemEditor>//en/node/6968]] for details on how to use RTSystemEditor
-- Start both components by double-clicking TkJoyStickComp.bat and TkMobileRobotSimulator.bat.
-- Click once on the [Create] button in the GUI of TkMobileRobotSimulator.
-- Since both components are displayed in the Name Service View of RTSystemEditor, drag them onto SystemEditor.
-- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (Refer to RTSystemEditor execution example above)
-- Right-click either component and select [Activate Systems].
-- By dragging the center point on the screen of TkJoystickComp, the pentagonal object (representing the robot) on TkMobileRobotSimulator moves. Moving the TkJoystick component in the Y direction (vertical direction) determines the speed of movement in the direction of the pentagonal object, and moving the component in the X direction (left and right) determines the speed and direction of rotation.
