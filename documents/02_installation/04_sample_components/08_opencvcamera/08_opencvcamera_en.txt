// Title: OpenCVCamera
#contents

This sample is included with OpenRTM-aist C ++ Windows version.
Note that OpenRTM-aist is not included in the C ++ version and you need to build and install them on Linux by using [[OpenCV Sample Code Build Procedure>//node/6975]]. It is not included in the Python version or the Java version.

*** Overview
By starting OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer, the image of the USB camera is displayed on the monitor. You can connect the OpenCV image processing sample RTC component and apply effects.

*** How to use
OpenCVCamera is a sample that acquires image data of a USB camera and displays it on a monitor with the CameraViewer component.
You can also connect an Image processing OpenCV sample RT component between them to apply effects to image data.


-Procedure
-- Start RTSystemEditor and open a new SystemEditor. See [[RTSystemEditor>//en/node/6968]] for details on how to use RTSystemEditor.
-- Start both OpenCVCamera (openCVCamera.bat) and CameraViewer (CameraViewer.bat) components.
--- To use the sample OpenCV image processing RT component, after installation, from Start> OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86_64> C ++ _ OpenCV-Examples (Start in a 32bit environment> OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86> Start from C ++ _ OpenCV-Examples).
-- Since these components appear in the Name Service View of RTSystemEditor, drag both of them to SystemEditor.
-- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (Refer to RTSystemEditor execution example above)
-- Right-click either component and select [Activate Systems].

- Use OpenCV's Flip
-- Start the Flip component from Start> OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86_64> C ++ _ OpenCV-Examples (in a 32-bit environment, start from Start> OpenRTM-aist 1.2.1 x86> C ++ _ OpenCV-Examples).
-- Drag it onto the SystemEditor to display it, connect to both the OpenCVCamera and CameraViewer components and activate it. (See "Example of Flip execution (RTSystemEditor)" below)
-- Flip can change the output data by changing the value of Configure “flip_mode”. (Refer to "Change flip_mode (RTSystemEditor and monitor)" below.)
--- Click [[here>//en/node/6807]] for the detailed usage and the explanation of Flip RT component.
