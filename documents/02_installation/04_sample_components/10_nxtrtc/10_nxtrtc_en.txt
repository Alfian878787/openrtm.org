**Running the samples

Connect to TkJoystickComp (input device) with GUI and TkMotorComp (output device), check motor control and values of LEGO.

For details, please refer to [[RT Component Creation (edited by LEGO Mindstorm)>/node/752]] manual.

//The motor of the LEGO robot can be controlled by connecting this component to
//the TkJoyStick component, or another component providing a compatible output
//port.

Use the following procedure to start the sample:
- Start RTSystemEditor and prepare SystemEditor. → For details on how to use RTSystemEditor, see [[RTSystemEditor >/node/1175]]
- [[here>/node/753]] please refer to the PC and LEGO Mindstorm with Bluetooth, or USB.
- Start NXTRTC.py, input device TkJoyStickComp.py, TkMotorComp, each component.
- Since components are displayed in NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor, drag them onto SystemEditor.
- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (See SystemEditor execution example above)
- Right-click on either component and select "All Activate".
//-Start RTSystemEditor.
//-Start LEGO Mindstorms from [[here>/en/node/763]], and connect the NXT to
//the PC with Bluetooth or USB.
//-Run NXTRTC.py, TkJoyStickComp.py and TkMotorComp.py.
//-The components are displayed in the name service view of RTSystemEditor. Add
//the components to the System Editor.
//-Drag and drop between the ports to connect them.
//-Activate the components.
