// Title: OpenCVCameraComp
#contents

This sample is included with the C++ edition of OpenRTM-aist in Windows. It is not included in the C++/Linux edition nor the Python or Java editions.

**Introduction

By launching OpenCVCameraComp and CameraViewerComp, images of the USB camera are displayed on the monitor. OpenCV sample that performs image processing You can connect an RTC component and apply an effect.

**Running the sample

OpenCVCameraComp is a USBCameraAqcuireComp component that acquires the image data of the USB camera and displays it on the monitor with the CameraViewerComp component. You can also connect an RTC sample component of OpenCV in between and apply an effect to the image data.

- Procedure
- Start RTSystemEditor and prepare SystemEditor. → For details on how to use RTSystemEditor, see [[RTSystemEditor >/node/1175]]
- Start both the OpenCVCameraComp and CameraViewerComp components.
--- To use the OpenCV Sample RT Component, please install it from Start > OpenRTM-aist1.1.2 > C++> Components> OpenCV-Example after installation.
- Since these components appear in NameServiceView of RTSystemEditor, drag both of them onto SystemEditor.
- Connect the corresponding ports of both components. (See the RTSystemEditor execution example above)
- Right-click on either component and select "All Activate".

- Use OpenCV's FlipComp
- Start FlipComp component > OpenRTM-aist1.1.2 > C++> Components > Please start from OpenCV-Example.
- Drag it onto SystemEditor, display it, connect it to both OpenCVCameraComp and CameraViewerComp "Activate". (See FlipComp execution example below)
- FlipComp can change the output data by changing the value of Configure "flip_mode". (See the change of flip_mode in the figure below)
--- Please see [[here:http://www.openrtm.org/openrtm/en/node/6057]] for detailed usage and explanation of FlipComp.
