** Introduction
Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer with an ARM processor developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in the UK.

The Raspberry Pi is very convenient because it runs normal Linux (Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux) and FreeBSD for ARM regardless of the size of the embedded board, and can also compile on the board.
Currently, for the storage device, the SD card can be used. It is inexpensive and has a large capacity. Also, the main board price is very low, about 3,000 yen.
Also, since basic I/O is provided and can be connected to various external devices, various applications such as robot control and measurement with sensors are conceivable.

*** Overview of this book

Using the I/O extension platform PiRT-Unit developed by AIST makes it possible to use external I/O relatively easily.

CENTER:'' PiRT-Unit ''

OpenRTM-aist (C++, Python, Java) can also be compiled and executed on the board, so even though it is an embedded board, it can be used in almost the same way as a normal Linux PC development process.

This section describes how to build an environment for developing and executing RT components with OpenRTM-aist, know-how for convenient use, how to control mobile robots, and how to use I/O.
