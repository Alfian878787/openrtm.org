// Title: Build from the source code (On Windows)
#contents

If you want to install from source package on Windows, you need to build OpenRTM-aist-Python yourself.

** Build environment
The following tools are required:
- Python
- omniORBpy
- Doxgen

Install it as described in the following.

*** Python
Requires Python 2.7 (or 3.6, 3.7). Please get the latest one from the following site and install it.

-[[Python Official Website:https://www.python.org/]]

In the following explanation, the following settings are required when installing Python. (Others are the default settings of the installer.)

- Set the installation destination to C: \ Python'''X.Y'''.
-- '''X.Y''' is 2.7, 3.6 or 3.7, eg C:\Python2.7
- In Python3.7, select [Customize Installation] during installation.
- The above directory must be included in the command search path (The path for python directory is added to the environment variable PATH).
-- In 3.7, if you check [Add Python to environmental variable] during installation, the installer will set PATH.
-- In the other cases, you need to set it manually.

*** omniORBpy

OpenRTM-aist-Python build requires an omniORBpy library. omniORBpy can obtain the necessary files from the links below.

-[[OpenRTM.org site:https://openrtm.org/pub/omniORB/win32/]]

You can also get the source from the official website.
-[[omniORB official:http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/]]
-[[sourceforge download page:http://sourceforge.net/projects/omniorb/files/omniORBpy/]]

We recommend that you use the latest version of the openrtm.org site file (currently 4.2.3) unless you have a specific reason to do so. There are multiple files, but the meanings of the file names are as follows. Select the file to be used according to the description.

The format of the file name is as follows.

omniORB-'''X.Y.Z'''-{win32|x64}-{vc100|vc110|vc120|vc140}-{py27|py36|py37}. zip

here,
:'''X.Y.Z''': | omniORB version, e.g. 4.2.3

:win32 | if 32-bit Python is used.
:x64 | if 64-bit Python is used.

: vc100 |If C ++ environment is used and the tool is Visual Studio 2010
: vc110 |If C ++ environment is used and the tool is Visual Studio 2012
: vc120 |If C ++ environment is used and the tool is Visual Studio 2013
: vc140 |If C ++ environment is used and the tool is Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019

: py27 | If Python 2.7 is used.
: py36 | If Python 3.6 is used.
: py37 | If Python 3.7 is used.

If you use omniORB 4.2.3 in 64bit Python 3.7 environment, download omniORB-4.2.3-x64-vc140-py37.zip.

**** How to install omniORB files

When the downloaded ZIP file is expanded, the following directory tree is expanded. Copy the files under each directory to the Python directory according to the instructions below.

In the following, I used '''x.y.''' for the version of the using omniORBpy and '''X.Y''' for the version of the using Python.
 + omniORBpy-x.y
  + bin
     + x86_win32-> Both exe and dll directly under C:\PythonX.Y
  + doc-> may be deleted
  + examples-> may be deleted
  + idl-> may be deleted, but may be deleted under C:\PythonX.Y\Lib\site-packages\omniORB\idl
  + lib
    + python-> The following directories and files as a whole C:\PythonX.Y\Lib\site-packages
    + x86_win32-> .pyd directly under C:\PythonX.Y\Lib\site-packages

*** Doxygen

-[[Doxygen:http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html]]

Download and execute the Windows version binary executable file from the web page.

// ------------------------------------------------ ------------
** Get source package

First, download the source code file OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.x.zip from the link below and extract it to an appropriate directory.

-[[OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.1:https://github.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist-Python/releases/tag/v1.2.1/]]

** Build

Start the command prompt, move to the directory where the source code was extracted earlier, and build with the following command.

 > python setup.py build

** Install
If everything is Ok for the builds, complete the installation with the following command:

 > python setup.py install

This completes the installation of OpenRTM-aist.
