// Title: Build from source (Linux)
#contents

If you want to install from the source package on Linux, you need to build OpenRTM-aist-Python yourself. The following explains the build procedure on Ubuntu 18.04.

** Supported OS and distribution
OpenRTM-aist-Python has been confirmed to work on the following OS and Linux distributions.
-Ubuntu
-Debian (Supporting versions of OPenRTM-aist are limited)
-Fedora (Supporting versions of OpenRTM-aist are limited )

You may be able to build OpenRTM-aist python on a Linux/UNIX environment other than the above if it is a normal Linux/UNIX environment.

** Dependent library
The following development environment and libraries are required to install OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.1.
- python: required to use build tools
- omniORBpy: Required for OpenRTM-aist build (IDL compilation)

Please install according to the documentation of each software. If these packages are installed under standard directories (/ usr, /usr/lib/, etc.), the subsequent OpenRTM-aist-Python build will be relatively easy.

On Ubuntu and Debian, you can install the software by the following command.
 $ sudo apt-get install python-omniorb-omg omniidl-python omniorb-nameserver

** Download source
Download the OpenRTM-aist-Python source.
- https://github.com/OpenRTM/OpenRTM-aist-Python/releases/tag/v1.2.1

** Extracting source code
- Unzip the source code package OpenRTM-aist-Python-1.2.1.tar.gz into an appropriate directory.
 $ tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X.tar.gz
 $ cd OpenRTM-aist-Python-X.X.X

** Build
OpenRTM-aist-Python uses the distutils module to build packages.
Build the package in the same way as other packages using distutils.
 $ python setup.py build [options]

Available options in [options] can be found by:
 $ python setup.py --help

** Install
After the build is completed successfully, install the Python modules and utility commands by the following command:
 $ sudo python setup.py install

This completes the build and installation from the source code.
