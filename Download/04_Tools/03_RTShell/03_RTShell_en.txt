**RTShell (CUI tools)

RTShell provides a set of tools for managing RT-Components and RT-Systems from a command-line shell. It is a replacement for RTSystemEditor designed for low-resource systems (such as robot control computers), and for scripting. Components can be activated, etc, and connections made without using RTSystemEditor or a GUI. RTShell commands can be used from shell scripting languages (such as batch files and Bashscript), allowing complex operations to be automated.
